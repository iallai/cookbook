> We will see that the key to forming compound data is that a programming language
should provide some kind of “glue” so that data objects can be combined to form more complex data objects.
There are many possible kinds of glue. Indeed, we will discover how to form com-pound data using no special “data” operations at all, only procedures.
This will further blur the distinction between “procedure” and “data,” which was already becoming tenuous toward the end of chapter 1. 
We will also explore some conventional techniques for representing sequences and trees. 
One key idea in dealing with compound data is the notion of closure—that the glue we use for combining data objects should allow us to combine not only primitive dataobjects,but compound data objects as well. 

> Another key idea is that compound data objects can serve as conventional interfaces for combining program modules in mix-and- match ways.
 We illustrate some of these ideas by presenting a simple graphics language that exploits closure.
