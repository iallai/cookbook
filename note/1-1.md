# Abstractions with Procedures			

## Computational Process

*Computational processes* are abstract beings that inhabit computer.

As they evolve, processes manipulate other abstract things called *_data_*.

The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a *_program_*.

## The Elements of Programming

Every powerful language has three mechanisms for accomplishing this:

- primitive expressions
- means of combination
- means of abstraction

### Expressions

``` scheme

```
Expressions such as these, formed by delimiting a list of expressions within parentheses in order to denote procedure application, are called *combinations*.

The leftmost element in the list is called the *operator*, and the other elements are called *operands*.
